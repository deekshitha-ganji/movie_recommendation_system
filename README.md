Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¥
Problem Statement
Build a recommendation system for movies based on user ratings. The system should suggest movies to users by predicting ratings for unseen movies, leveraging user preferences and ratings from other users.

Expected Outcome
A movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions and predicts ratings for movies users haven't rated yet.

Data Source
The MovieLens Dataset is used for training and evaluating the recommendation system. This dataset includes extensive movie ratings and metadata, ideal for collaborative filtering techniques.

Relevant Machine Learning Topics
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizing user-item interactions to make recommendations.
Recommendation Systems: Designing algorithms for personalized content suggestions.
Features
User-Based Recommendations: Suggest movies similar to those rated highly by the user.
Item-Based Recommendations: Predict ratings based on similar movies' ratings.
Genre Filtering: Tailored suggestions based on preferred genres.
Interactive Front-End: Input ratings, select genres, and receive movie suggestions in an intuitive UI.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the MovieLens dataset for analysis.
Collaborative Filtering: Use k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to find similar users/movies and predict ratings.
Genre Filtering: Match movies based on user-selected genres.
Prediction: Provide ratings for unseen movies and recommend top-rated options.
