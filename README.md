#Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¥
##Problem Statement
Build a recommendation system for movies based on user ratings. The system should suggest movies to users by predicting ratings for unseen movies, leveraging user preferences and ratings from other users.

##Expected Outcome
A movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions.
Predict ratings for movies users haven't rated yet.
##Data Source
The MovieLens Dataset: Used for training and evaluating the recommendation system.
This dataset includes extensive movie ratings and metadata, ideal for collaborative filtering techniques.
##Relevant Machine Learning Topics
1.**Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizing user-item interactions to make recommendations.
2.**Recommendation Systems**: Designing algorithms for personalized content suggestions.
##Features
1.**User-Based Recommendations**: Suggest movies similar to those rated highly by the user.
2.**Item-Based Recommendations**: Predict ratings based on similar movies' ratings.
3.**Genre Filtering**: Tailored suggestions based on preferred genres.
4.**Interactive Front-End**: Input ratings, select genres, and receive movie suggestions in an intuitive UI.
##How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the MovieLens dataset for analysis.
2. Collaborative Filtering: Use k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to find similar users/movies and predict ratings.
3. Genre Filtering: Match movies based on user-selected genres.
4.Prediction: Provide ratings for unseen movies and recommend top-rated options.
